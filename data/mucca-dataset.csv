576,147778,text,"As it turns out, there's only one reliable way to do this, which is to include the browser itself as part of the test runtime -- so that the JavaScript code is run by the actual browser and not by some ""simulation"" code in the test tool. "

579,147778,text,"2.- Even if they stay away from testing JavaScript &amp; rendering features, functional test scripts still tend to be (and probably need to be) expressed as:</p>			<p>   "
580,147778,text,"1/ Get URL A.   "
581,147778,text,"2/ Click on the link with text T.   "

583,147778,text,which require parsing and analysis of the returned HTML. 
584,147778,text,"This is generally a costly operation, which plays against you when load testing.</p>			<p>"

829,147801,text,"(See code example question below)</p>			<p>"
830,147801,text,I am currently working in a grid environment. 
831,147801,text,"My company uses a cluster ofgrid ""nodes"" in order to facilitate processing batch and real-timetransactions. "
832,147801,text,"I have been tasked with benchmarking web services transactionsrunning through our grid. "
833,147801,text,"I recently built a software router to handlesubscriptions to a load-balancer (BigIP - F5). "
834,147801,text,"So, my first task with JMeterwill be to benchmark the registration/withdrawal of subscriptions throughthis setup.</p>			<p>"
835,147801,text,"One of the problems that presents itself to me is that - all grid nodes are""hands-off"" to users of the grid. "
836,147801,text,"In other words, the only control over agrid node is through a web page (or 'generic' user). "
837,147801,text,"There is no way tomanually log on to the grid node. "
838,147801,text,"Also, since the grid nodes rely on NFSshares to read-write to/from files (unsuggested), there is no good way tomaintain a list of all grid nodes belonging to one ""cluster"", as nodescome-up and go-down.</p>			<p>"
839,147801,text,My plan is to set up many nodes that will serve as remote JMeter engines. 
840,147801,text,"Inmy situation, it would be beneficial to me to allow the controlling client(gui) to automatically ""discover"" all nodes and their ip addresses asparticipants in the remote pool of servers. "
841,147801,text,"This way - I don't have to jumpthrough hoops to setup all the ip addresses from all the remote servers inthe controllers property file.</p>			<p>"
842,147801,text,"I am currently trying to discover how the remote server portion of the codeworks exactly.</p>			<p>"
843,147801,text,"I have noticed in the class:""RemoteJMeterEngineImpl.java""that there is a method, "" public void setHost(String host)"".</p>			<p>"
844,147801,text,"Does this method get called during the client setup or during the remoteservers' setup?</p>			<p>"
845,147801,text,"How about having the Remote server discover its own IP address....i.e.</p>			<p>    "
846,147801,code,"InetAddress local = InetAddress.getLocalHost();    _hostname = local.getHostAddress();</p>			<p>"
847,147801,text,...instead of just the name of the host. 
848,147801,text,"(NOTE: the above code retrieves theactual ip address)</p>			<p>"
849,147801,text,"Then, after the remote server discovers its ipaddress, it could ""push"" it tothe controlling client - whose address is specified in a deployed propertyfile.</p>			<p>"
850,147801,text,"So the idea is - deploy a JMeter remote engine along with a property/configfile containing the controlling clients ip address....and then have all theremote servers ""push"" their ip address back to the (already running) client.</p>			<p>"

4236,148077,text,"1. (200 votes) Release the 20 nodes barrier</p>		<p>"
4237,148077,text,"Interesting that the top issue is essentially a plea for more performance! "
4238,148077,text,"Some of this will clearly be from frustrated long-term node operators with fast links that Freenet doesn't use, but imho it represents a more general problem: Freenet is slow!</p>		<p>"
4239,148077,text,"2. (150 votes) One GUI for all</p>		<p>"
4240,148077,text,"Theoretically this is a demand for a new non-web GUI, but IMHO the important aspects are integrating more functionality and improving the web UI generally; people are quite happy in general with web applications, nobody uses a real email client any more except geeks.</p>		<p>"
4241,148077,text,"3. (120 votes) Add a 'pause' feature</p>		<p>"
4242,148077,text,This is a remarkably high ranking. 
4243,148077,text,"It suggests we have a lot of gamers, and some easy way to tell the node to go into a mode where it uses as little bandwidth as possible, while still being able to get back into the network quickly when it is restored, is very popular. "
4244,148077,text,"Maybe we should expedite this, post 0.8-beta1?</p>		<p>"
4245,148077,text,"4. (101 votes) Show a progress screen when loading a page</p>		<p>"
4246,148077,text,This is a surprisingly low ranking IMHO. 
4247,148077,text,"Anyway it will be implemented soon. "
4248,148077,text,"Hopefully similar measures for pages with images on will help too, they are most likely part of sashee's GSoC.</p>		<p>"
4249,148077,text,"5. (73 votes) Implement reinsert on demand</p>		<p>"
4250,148077,text,This is about more reliable filesharing. 
4251,148077,text,"Broadly, the concern here is that inserted content does not remain fetchable for very long - if it is not requested, typically 2 weeks or so. "
4252,148077,text,"IMHO this is bad: clearly we will not be able to cache everything, but given the average datastore size (big) and the average bandwidth limit (small), content ought to last longer than that. "
4253,148077,text,"We need to be able to quantify this with regular automated tests, we need to investigate to what degree it is caused by newbie nodes, churn etc, fix the uptime estimate code to not only update on connect, implement Bloom filter sharing (which should help significantly imho), and maybe investigate with simulations. "
4254,148077,text,"Much of the time the problem is that the top block has disappeared; once found the rest of the data can be found relatively quickly. "
4255,148077,text,So duplicating the top block is fairly important. 
4256,148077,text,"Another weakness is that the last segment in a splitfile may have much less redundancy than the rest; this can be fixed by making the last 2 segments the same size. "
4257,148077,text,"Also, we should consider whether to further increase the level of redundancy, especially in the store: the 3 nodes (on average) which stored (not cached) the data may very well be offline when we fetch it, so unpopular content will frequently not be fetchable. "
4258,148077,text,"Persistent requests may help in the long term. IMHO Freenet ought to be good at somewhat unpopular content.</p>		<p>"
4259,148077,text,"To deal with the issue itself more specifically: infinity0's SoC will be to implement a distributed file indexing/searching system. "
4260,148077,text,"This might eventually support insert on demand, however insert on demand has serious anonymity issues. "
4261,148077,text,"In 0.9 we will scramble the splitfile insertion keys in order to prevent this vulnerability, however arguably this will exacerbate the underlying problem, so we may want to reinsert under random keys and then have some of the recipients insert under non-scrambled keys. "
4262,148077,text,"Obviously, metadata including the hash(es) of the file contents as well as its length will help here; this will probably be a post 0.8 feature, realistically.</p>		<div class=""footer list-management"">			<p>				"

7072,148317,text,"And there should			<br></br>			be different versions available, to support more ArgoUML versions or to allow			<br></br>			maintainance and further development. "
7073,148317,text,"How to organize this? Must the version			<br></br>			number of a module follow some rule? "
7074,148317,text,Where should it be diplayed?

8233,148381,text,"Reason:All over the code to calculate the height of the class and itscompartments the assumption is made that one element in e.g. theattribute Vector (_attrVec) equals one height of ROWHEIGHT units. "

9230,148442,text,"There are other advantages of my proposal: Using different styles for 1ModelElement leads to all kinds of exceptional decisions to be made: e.g.suppose you have ClassA in yellow on diagram1, and ClassA in red indiagram2, and I add the same ClassA to diagram3, what color should it thenbe?

9488,148463,junk,"&gt; Please reference my recent email on ""buildThing()"" and ""createThing()""  &gt; before reading further, otherwise it might not make sense.  &gt;  &gt; The current state of Argo is that the create methods right now are  &gt; only the equivalent of ""new MThingImpl()"".  The only difference  &gt; between ""createThing()"" and ""new MThingImpl()"" is the addition of the  &gt; listener, which never existed before.  &gt;  &gt; I can see that possibly someone may need to create an instance of UML  &gt; Class (""createClass()"") but initialize it in a different way.  Putting  &gt; all the class initialization into ""createClass()"" would disallow that.  &gt; And if the class is being created in a third-party plugin, that would  &gt; require them to use a hack to actually create the instance.  &gt;  &gt; I think it would be best to leave ""createThing()"" as is (only  &gt; initializing those attributes and functionality that we need _EVERY_  &gt; MThing to contain, such as the listener), and implement generic  &gt; initialization process in ""buildThing()"".  That's basically what  &gt; MMUtil does now, and the MMUtil ""buildThing()"" no-argument methods  &gt; probably can be shifted into the factory classes verbatim.  &gt;  &gt;  &gt; -----Original Message-----  &gt; From: Jaap Branderhorst [mailto:			<span>				jaap				<a class=""email mklink"">...</a>				@xs4all.nl			</span>			]  &gt; Sent: Tuesday, August 06, 2002 8:43 AM  &gt; To: 			<span>				de				<a class=""email mklink"">...</a>				@argouml.tigris.org			</span>			  &gt; Subject: RE: [argouml-dev] How do we handle creation of complex  &gt; modeleleme nts?  &gt;  &gt;  &gt; This sounds very reasonably and is exactly as i see it with one small  &gt; exception: i think that we need methods that create default  &gt; modelelements. So the methods createThing() should be public too and  &gt; initialize the modelelement to its default values. Kind regards,  &gt;  &gt; Jaap  &gt;  &gt;  &gt;&gt; The factory package structure was also populated with empty Helper  &gt;&gt; classes corresponding to the Factory classes (UseCasesHelper for  &gt;&gt; UseCasesFactory, etc.).  The approach I was going to take in the long  &gt;&gt; term was to try to migrate most element creation calls from MMUtil  &gt;&gt; and  other places into the factories, and any other types of methods  &gt;&gt; from MMUtil and other places into the helpers.  &gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt; My vision was for the factories to only have ""public MThing  &gt;&gt; createThing(...)"" methods with varying arguments.  So looking at  &gt;&gt; MMUtil, the methods buildAssociation and buildAssociationEnd could be  &gt;&gt; moved to the factory.  buildParameter() poses a conflict since it has  &gt;&gt; no arguments (perhaps it could be called with a string argument that  &gt;&gt; gets passed to the p.findtype() instead of the hardcoded ""void""?).  &gt;&gt; buildOperation(), buildClass(), and buildAttribute() (among others)  &gt;&gt; pose a similar conflict. Utility functions such as getAttributes()  &gt;&gt; and  &gt;&gt; getAssociationEnds() could get moved to the helper most closely  &gt;&gt; related to the argument being passed (for those two examples  &gt;&gt; Mclassifier, therefore into CoreHelper).  &gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt; While I am writing this, however, I'm leaning toward the approach to  &gt;&gt; only have ""public MThing createThing()"" be the equivalent of ""new  &gt;&gt; MThingImpl()"" and for ""public MThing buildThing(....)"" have any  &gt;&gt; additional initialization that needs to be done.  And  &gt;&gt; ""buildThing(...)"" would call ""createThing()"" internally to create the  &gt;&gt; appropriate instance, then fill in the necessary blanks.  &gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt; Does this sound reasonable?  &gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt; -----Original Message-----  &gt;&gt; From: Jaap Branderhorst [mailto:			<span>				jaap				<a class=""email mklink"">...</a>				@xs4all.nl			</span>			]  &gt;&gt; Sent: Tuesday, August 06, 2002 8:13 AM  &gt;&gt; To: 			<span>				de				<a class=""email mklink"">...</a>				@argouml.tigris.org			</span>			  &gt;&gt; Subject: [argouml-dev] How do we handle creation of complex  &gt;&gt; modelelements?  &gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt; Hi,  &gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt; At the moment the creation of complex modelelements (in other words:  &gt;&gt; modelelements containing other modelelements) is done by the build  &gt;&gt; methods in MMUtil.

10516,148515,text,I am having some problems to understand what you mean here.

10518,148515,text,"1. Save the model."
10519,148515,text,"2. Run ant in the directory where the model is saved.</p>					<p>"

10523,148515,text,"1. Add a function in ArgoUML that generates a file to control the ant andxslt-engine that could generate an html-view of the model. "
10524,148515,text,"The only purposeof this file is so that the user can run ant.</p>					<p>"
10525,148515,text,"___again, this would be a command line thing. "
10526,148515,text,"Until the xslt is built forgenerating docs, and the argo.xml has a little more data retention, I'mfocusing on pgml.</p>					<p>"
10527,148515,text,2. Add xslt and ant to the ArgoUML distribution.

10532,148515,text,"I also think that reports or models presented like this would be more usefulwhen they are created in pdf because of the tighter coupling between thepictures and the rest of the text and the graphics is a lot better thanHTML+gif, especially when it comes to having big diagrams with the need todo scaling to fit them on a page. </p>					<p>"

10869,148530,text,"They do that via UMLDispatch,ThirdPartyEventlListener.    "
10870,148530,text,"These classes are extremely coupled with the property panels."
10871,148530,text,"(UMLDispatch only dispatches    events to java.awt.Components for instance....)"
10872,148530,text,"3. Like I stated before, ArgoUML tends to fire too much events to all kindsof objects that don't need    those events. "
10873,148530,text,"I want to change that."

10875,148530,text,"See issues 1320/1321 for instance."
10876,148530,text,"That depends directly on    the way Figs handle events and if the Figs are registred with theelement the event fires.</p>		<p>"

10878,148530,text,"For a review of why to useevents: see any good book on the Model view controller pattern or theObserver pattern for example. "
10879,148530,text,"I am certain that other developers who readthis mail can give you a splendid explanation (better then I can). "
10880,148530,text,"To reachthe goals I described above, I don't need another event structure.</p>		<p>"
10881,148530,text,I did not want to redesign the NSUML event model.

10883,148530,text,I don't know.

10886,148530,text,"- a type (which type of event is this, did the model try to add something toa list or not?)"
10887,148530,text,"- the old and new values of the changed attribute"
10888,148530,text,The type does not give any extra information.

10891,148530,text,The old and new values don't give enough information. 
10892,148530,text,"You cannot base adecission on the old and nev values to decide what kind of event you have."
10893,148530,text,"The only thing that is left is the eventName.</p>		<p>"
10894,148530,text,"I do aggree with you Linus, that using a event hierarchy instead of checkingon the eventName will reduce the number of bugs and will reduce the couplingbetween 'argouml' and NSUML. "
10895,148530,text,"But I also strongly believe in an evolutionarydesign process. "
10896,148530,text,"I first want to introduce the ModelEventPump and still usethe NSUML event mechanism before I introduce a totally new event mechanismwhat we need if we want to seperate argouml as much as possible from NSUML."

10898,148530,text,"If you have ideas on this new event mechanisme, you are more then welcome tocontribute that to the discussion. "
10899,148530,text,"As soon as we have aggreed on that newmechanism AND as soon as we have centralized the model event handling in theModelEventPump, I think that we can move towards that new mechanism.</p>		<p>"

10901,148530,text,"Maybe you can explain that in other words to me?</p>		<p>"
10902,148530,text,"As you can read in the javadoc with the method cleanUp(), this method isneeded for testing. "
10903,148530,text,"That's why it has a visibility of 'default' and not ofprivate or public. "
10904,148530,text,IMHO tests should be atomic.

10906,148530,text,"The fact that test A fails does not say anything about test B."

12586,148628,text,1. argouml-mdr java-interfaces.jar build failure 
12587,148628,text,"- This appears to be aproblem with the compiler classpath.  "
12588,148628,text,"I haven't had a chance to look at ityet, but I'm sure it's soluable.  "
12589,148628,text,"My first guess would be that we'redepending on having a Java compiler on the O/S path and that those who'vehad the problems don't have this.</p>			<p>"
12590,148628,text,"1a. argouml-mdr problems in general - This is the only project that had anexisting .project and .classpath checked in to CVS, but it also had them in.cvsignore.  "
12591,148628,text,"Since I was trying to minimize disruption, I left them in.cvsignore and I'm sure that these two factors account for some of theweirdness that Linus has seen with this specific project.</p>			<p>"
12592,148628,text,"2. Eclipse 3.2M5 doesn't work - Project import is broken in that version."
12593,148628,text,"Use a different version of Eclipse for the import.</p>			<p>"
12594,148628,text,"3. Argouml 'package' target doesn't work - The only targets that have beenupdated for the new structure are the 'genparser' or similar targets whichare needed to generate source files.  "
12595,148628,text,"I'm going to start work on the rest ofthe targets now.</p>			<p>"
12596,148628,text,4. What about the modules? 
12597,148628,text,"- I did a couple of the ones that reside in themain project just to understand what the problems are, but in general theyaren't complete.  "
12598,148628,text,"I plan to do all the bundled modules, but will probablyask the module project leads to help with others, particularly ones whichare in separate Tigris projects.  "
12599,148628,text,"I don't have a good view of which modulesare dead or just placeholders that have never been activated.</p>			<p>"
12600,148628,text,4a. The argouml-module-cpp project isn't set up - This is an oversight.  
12601,148628,text,"Iincluded this in the modules project set, but then didn't check in therelevant .project and .classpath files because I was concerned aboutdisrupting Luis' setup.  "
12602,148628,text,I should have removed it from the project set.  
12603,148628,text,"I'dbe interested in hearing from Luis about the proposed setup since he alreadyhas a fine grain project structure that he uses.</p>			<p>"
12604,148628,text,"5. How do we create new projects?  Who is responsible for updating buildpaths, etc - We can discuss this, but my model is that this works the sameway it works now.  "
12605,148628,text,"If you change something that affects the build, youchange everything required.  "
12606,148628,text,"From a practical point of view, this will meanediting both the default.properties file and the .classpath file when ajar's name is changed.  "
12607,148628,text,"Creating a new project will mean creating a newbuild.xml and Eclipse project as well as changing any of the existing oneswhich are effected.  "
12608,148628,text,"Usually this means cloning an existing project which isclose to what you want and modifying it, so the process should be prettystraightforward.</p>		</div>		<p>"
12609,148628,text,"Ok, so you port all the modules including mines to this setup. "
12610,148628,text,"There is 2 modules (argouml-andromda, argosoffice) and the argoumlinstaller.</p>		<div class=""quote quote-1"">			<p>"
12611,148628,text,"6. Why are there four projects instead of one for the main project (src_new,lib, tools, tests) "
12612,148628,text,"- Because Eclipse can't deal with nested/overlappingdirectory hierarchies.  "
12613,148628,text,"If we were to have an Eclipse project at the root ofargouml, we couldn't have any other projects using any of the otherdirectories.</p>			<p>"
12614,148628,text,7. Why are argouml-mdr tests exported? 
12615,148628,text,"- Eclipse exports all source classesand I don't think there's a way to change this.  "
12616,148628,text,"We could create a separateargouml-mdr-tests project, but it doesn't seem like a big deal to me.</p>			<p>"
12617,148628,text,"8. Build dependencies vs run dependencies - Linus mentioned having to addargouml-mdr as a requirement of the argouml-core-tests project in order tobe able to run tests, but was concerned about having the implementationclasses exposed.  "
12618,148628,text,"Eclipse manages build and run classpaths separately, butyou need to define a run configuration using Run... to get the run classpathto be different from the build class path.  "
12619,148628,text,"I think Run configurations arethe right way to do this rather than adding build dependencies just for theconvenience of having them available at runtime.</p>			<p>"
12620,148628,text,"9. Updating both build &amp; run configurations - Having to update runconfigurations is definitely a nuisance.  "
12621,148628,text,"The pain is increase by theconvention of changing jar names with every release and the frequentupdates.  "
12622,148628,text,"I've recently discovered Eclipse's shared run configurations andwill attempt to use those, and perhaps Eclipse variables, to try to minimizethe problem.  "
12623,148628,text,"I should point out that this is a problem that we all haveindividually today, so the worst case is that the pain stays the same, butI'm hopeful that there's a way to improve on the current situation.</p>			<p>"
12624,148628,text,"10. Project settings vs. Workspace settings - Using a separate workspace forArgoUML is one way to manage settings, but not using per-project settingswill basically mandate that everyone organize their projects this way."
12625,148628,text,"Personally I keep all my active projects in a single workspace, but if themajority want to avoid using per-project settings, I'll go along.  "
12626,148628,text,"As far ascreating new projects goes, it's as simple as copying the .settingsdirectory from an existing project to get it set up.  "
12627,148628,text,"That doesn't seem veryhard to me.</p>			<p>"
12628,148628,text,"11. Checkclipse - At least one of the projects has a Checkclipse ""builder""defined, but not enabled.  "
12629,148628,text,"My intention was to have Checkclipse builders andsettings defined for all projects and then discuss whether or not to havethem turned on by default.  "
12630,148628,text,"I personally think it would be a good idea tohave the builder turned on by default so that the warnings are visible inthe IDE window as people work.</p>			<p>"
12631,148628,text,"12. Use Maven so we can support NetBeans and IntelliJ - Since everydeveloper that I'm aware of uses Eclipse for their IDE, this isn't somethingthat I'm willing to invest effort in.</p>		</div>		<p>"

15271,148865,text,"I think an additionalcallback in IoFilter is needed.  "
15272,148865,text,"In the case of the proxy filters, thefilter needs to be able to specify what the remote address should bebased on the service address.  "
15273,148865,text,"Each proxy filter needs to see theoriginal service address to decide which proxy to use or even whether touse the proxy (for example, maybe it doesn't proxy for local sub-nets)."
15274,148865,text,"It will also need to be able to determine what the remote address iswhen ""nextFilter"" returns -- in case it was modified by another proxyfilter -- so it knows what address to connect to through the proxy."
15275,148865,text,"Finally, it must be able to report what its has established as theremote address for any proxy filters behind it in the chain.</p>			<p>"

15281,148865,text,"A possible workaround is to program the proxy filter to wrap thecreated IoSession instance so all requests and session information areoverride, but this approach has a few problems that 1) the filter hasno control over what ConnectFuture returns and 2) you have to specifythe address of the proxy server in connect() call, which is nottransparent at all.</p>		<p>"
15282,148865,text,"For now, I can't think of any way to implement a reusable proxy as anIoFilter.  "
15283,148865,text,"It's like you can't create a proxy by wrapping existingInputStream and OutputStream; you have to provide a SocketFactory.</p>		<p>"
15284,148865,text,"I'd suggest you to create an IoConnector implementation that wrapsanother IoConnector.  "

15287,148865,text,"In the example above, ProxyConnector could use its underlyingSocketConnector to connect to the proxyAddress and intercept andfilter  all events from the SocketConnector using ProxyConnector'sinternal IoHandler implementation.</p>		<p>"

18261,149146,text,"I've read the FAQ entry titled ""Do I need to make my IoHandler thread- safe?"", but was still a bit confused. "
18262,149146,text,"So I've built a simple sample  application.</p>		<p>"
18263,149146,text,"The server checks how many threads are executing the code of the  messageReceived method of the IoHandler. "
18264,149146,text,"The client sends a lot of  messages to the server. "
18265,149146,text,"To simulate a long running task, the  messageReceived method of the server contains a Thread.sleep.</p>		<p>"
18266,149146,text,"Without adding any filter (in particular the ThreadPoolFilter, of  course), the messageReceived method of the server IoHandler is  executed by just one thread at a time (in fact, always the same  thread). "
18267,149146,text,"The overall throughput of the server is low (the server was  sleeping most of the time...).</p>		<p>"
18268,149146,text,After adding a ThreadPool filter the situation changed. 
18269,149146,text,"The IoHandler  messageReceived method is called by more than one thread at a time  (server-side). "
18270,149146,text,"However, the method is called by only one thread at a  time for a particular session.</p>		<p>"
18271,149146,text,"What I find a bit strange is that on the server-side, there is only  one IoHandler for all the sessions. "
18272,149146,text,"Therefore it is unsafe to use any  instance variables inside handlers (that is, without proper  synchronization). "
18273,149146,text,"I guess that's what is meant with ""shared resource""  in the FAQ. "
18274,149146,text,"To achieve thread safety, the state should be stored as  session attributes (correct?) or the access would have to be properly  synchronized.</p>		<p>"
18275,149146,text,"On the client side, it is possible to specify a separate IoHandler  for each session. "
18276,149146,text,"Wouldn't it be more natural to have the possibility  to store state in the handler itself? "
18277,149146,text,"On the server, this would  require to have a separate IoHandler for each session. "

18521,149173,text,"<div class=""messagebody"" id=""body"">	<div class=""pws"">		<p>Hello,</p>		<p>    After travelling, recovering from a cold, and catching up after theabove, I'm ready to tackle a couple more JMeter patches.  "
18522,149173,text,"But I've got acouple of questions before I put the finishing touches on the patchesand send them in.</p>		<p>    "
18523,149173,text,"The goal of the first patch is to reduce the size of SampleResultobjects.  "
18524,149173,text,"There are a couple of unused fields, and some other fieldswhich are sometimes used but take up a fair amount of memory even incases where they are not being used.  "
18525,149173,text,"I would like to fix these toreduce memory usage and improve the serialization of these objects.</p>		<p>"
18526,149173,text,"1) The ""map"" and ""mark"" fields don't appear to be used at all.  "
18527,149173,text,"I planto get rid of these completely.</p>		<p>"
18528,149173,text,"2) ""assertionResults"", ""subResults"", and ""files"" can be used in somecases, but not always.  "
18529,149173,text,"Instead of instantiating these fieldsimmediately, I plan to use lazy instantiation to create the List/Setobjects only when they are actually needed.</p>		<p>"
18530,149173,text,"3) If we use lazy instantiation for these fields, should thecorresponding ""get"" methods return null if the fields haven't been set? "
18531,149173,text,Or should they return an empty List/Set?  
18532,149173,text,"I would prefer null, but thecalling code has to be able to handle this.  "
18533,149173,text,"I can make sure that anycalling code in JMeter will handle this properly, but this change couldbreak any user-written code that might rely on getting back a non-nullreference.  "
18534,149173,text,"So maybe it would be better to return an empty List/Set fornow, and then next time we have a significant API change we can makethis change as well.</p>		<p>"
18535,149173,text,"4) Today's SampleResult isn't thread-safe, so I assume my newmodifications don't have to be thread-safe either.  "
18536,149173,text,"I haven't studiedthe code enough to determine whether or not JMeter allows SampleResultto be accessed concurrently by more than one thread.  "
18537,149173,text,"My lazyinstantiation code will probably be less thread-safe than the existingcode, so it could possibly break something that works today.  "
18538,149173,text,"I can makeit thread-safe if it needs to be, but I won't add the extra overhead ifit's not necessary.</p>		<p>    "
18539,149173,text,I think that's it.  
18540,149173,text,"If you have any questions, let me know. "
18541,149173,text,"Otherwise, I should have a patch ready soon after I get a thumbs-up onthe above.</p>		<p>			"

19723,149277,text,"There are still quite a few classes that assume that there is only one HTTPSampler (i.e. using the standard Java classes). "
19724,149277,text,"I'd like to generalize this,to make it easier for users to choose which implementation they want to use.</p>		<p>"
19725,149277,text,"The proposed changes fall under several areas.</p>		<p>"
19726,149277,junk,"HTTP GUI========"
19727,149277,text,"It seems to me that it would be useful to combine the GUIs, and add a meansto select the implementation on the default page or the sampler itself,probably as a drop-down list showing the handler types. "
19728,149277,text,"I propose to do thisby extending the original GUI class, and removing the new one.</p>		<p>"
19729,149277,text,"This will mean that saved test plans using the new GUI would no longer work,but I think that can be overcome by using the upgrade.properties file tochange the class name, and including some special handling to change thevalue of the HTTP handler field accordingly.</p>		<p>"
19730,149277,text,"I also propose to add a property to select the default handler, so thatusers could use existing original test plans and have them automatically usea new handler. "
19731,149277,text,"This would only apply if the test plan did not specify thevalue. "
19732,149277,text,"[I suppose there could also be a handler override property.]</p>		<p>"
19733,149277,junk,"Static Factory=========="
19734,149277,text,"It would probably be useful to have a static factory to create an instanceof the appropriate handler."
19735,149277,text,"This would contain various methods for chosing the appropriate sampler, e.g.by name, by class, by instance."
19736,149277,text,It can also have a default handler that is decided at run-time. 
19737,149277,text,"[Could bepart of HTTPSamplerBase, I suppose.]</p>		<p>"
19738,149277,junk,"Samplers that extend or use HTTPSampler============================="
19739,149277,text,"These are AccessLog, Soap, and WebService."
19740,149277,text,"It seems to me that rather than extending HTTPSampler, these could create aninstance of the an HTTP sampler and use that."
19741,149277,text,This would allow the existing HTTPSamplers to be made final. 
19742,149277,text,"Then it wouldbe possible to change which handler to use. "
19743,149277,text,"[I've not looked into how one should present the option to the user.]</p>		<p>"

19745,149277,text,"The Proxy classes currently assume that it generates only HTTPSamplerclasses; this could be made variable fairly easily.</p>		<p>"
19746,149277,junk,"The trickier bit=========="
19747,149277,text,"At least it seems to be the trickiest part:</p>		<p>"
19748,149277,text,"The HtmlParsingUtils.createUrlFromAnchor() method needs to create an HTTPSampler; this is currently the original sampler.</p>		<p>"
19749,149277,text,"As far as I can see, this needs to create a sampler of the same type as theone the caller is using, but there does not seem to be any way to obtainthis information currently, and there is no guarantee that the same handlerwill be used throughout a test.</p>		<p>"
19750,149277,text,"It would be possible to pass in the original instance of the class (or atleast the class name), but the hierarchy is quite complicated (it includes arecursive call), so before proceeding further, it would be useful to know ifI'm correct in thinking that it needs to choose the correct sampler?</p>		<p>"
19751,149277,text,"What do you all think?</p>		<p>"

21369,149425,text,"I've not yet had time to isolate and rationalize the problems I've run into, so I can post them as specific bugs and enhancement proposals, but here's a quick description. "
21370,149425,text,"Please don't take it for what it's not: it's intended to be constructive criticism: I appreciate the speed at which JMeter is improving and I hope knowledge of these limitations will help working in the right (or at least in the most urgent) direction:</p>		<p>"
21371,149425,text,"- The HTTPSampler and the HTTP Proxy don't allow POST requests with additional parameters in the query string (in the URI).</p>		<p>"
21372,149425,text,"- The HTTPSampler and the HTTP Proxy fail on redirects which carry parameters in the query string (they do the redirect but don't pass the parameters on).</p>		<p>"
21373,149425,text,"- The HTTPSampler generates one single Sample even if it does a redirect. This makes debugging the scripts really difficult, because the information on the original request is lost (you only get the page at the end of the redirect).</p>		<p>"
21374,149425,text,"- It's not possible to use any unusual characters in request parameters: the HTTPSampler will always URLEncode them -- even if they were not encoded when the HTTP Proxy received them.</p>		<p>"
21375,149425,text,"- I would summarize all of the above in that they get too much in the way -- mainly for the HTTP Proxy.</p>		<p>"
21376,149425,text,"- When trying to correct the above, I ran into lots of trouble because the protocol.http packages are too convoluted: looks like each class is tightly coupled to each other class there. "
21377,149425,text,"I think those packages call for refactoring.</p>		<p>"
21378,149425,text,- The interface to edit the request parameters needs much improvement. 
21379,149425,text,"I had lots of parameter names 30 or 40 characters long which was really hard to edit in that very small field which only accepts deleting and writing at the end. "
21380,149425,text,"Add a __regexp function to cope with variable form field names and it's madness.</p>		<p>"
21381,149425,text,- Do we really need embedded functions? 
21382,149425,text,"I have a feeling that just having placeholders (aka variables) and modifiers to define them would do the job just as well, and would be much simpler.</p>		<p>"
21383,149425,text,- The View Results Tree Listener is a very useful debugging tool. 
21384,149425,text,"I was just missing the information sent in POST requests and a ""browse"" button. "
21385,149425,text,"Would also be cool if it labelled events as per the originating sampler, instead of the URL. "
21386,149425,text,"A ""clean"" button would also be extremely handy.</p>		<p>"
21387,149425,text,"- I also saw the agregate report throwing lots of ConcurrentUpdateExceptions ... don't yet know if they are harmful.</p>		<p>"
21388,149425,text,"- The counters in the User Parameter Modifier are not ""thread safe"": each counter goes its own way. "
21389,149425,text,To put a simpler equivalent example: 
21390,149425,text,"I had registered users named ""user1"" to ""user200"" with passwords ""pwd1"" to ""pwd200"", and I found no way to ensure each thread would properly log in. "
21391,149425,text,"My case was even worse because I needed to use the same number in two consecutive pages. "
21392,149425,text,"We need variables (not only constants) real soon (in case they are not already there).</p>		<p>"
21393,149425,text,"- The same goes for the need to use the same regexps again and again -- which very badly affected the performance of my scripts -- variables and modifiers would probably cure this.</p>		<p>"
21394,149425,text,"Finally, less urgent but probably most important, I feel the code is generally too convoluted. "
21395,149425,text,"I can't tell if it's only in the http packages as I mentioned before or it's a more general problem, but the result is that it makes the threshold for new contributors very high. "
